# Heterogeneous-Ensemble-random-forest
Heterogeneous Ensemble is a set of classifiers of different types built upon same data. It is uses different types of decision trees at different parts of the problem, so by combining them, the overall performance of the ensemble can be improved. I conducted an analysis to investigate the random forest.
Machine Learning predicitive analysis was done  on two different dataset using heterogeneous ensemble random forest.
The analysis was conducted using python in jupyter notebook and the following libraries were used:
Pandas
RandomForestClassifier
Numpy
decisionTreeClassifer

The data is loaded and is prepared for creating a model, then the model and is trained and tested and a test is done to check its performance. Upon complition the churn dataset model had its results came out highand this  meant a good ensemble was achieved while insurance dataset moadel had lower results
